# Motivation 

---
# Imagine a project ...
**You are given:**
- Gene expression data for some cancer samples

- A gene experssion signature 

**You are asked to:**
- Find out which samples are more concordant with that signature?

- Communicate the analyses with your colleagues

---
# How I used to do these without R Markdown

I would have:

- a folder with several analysis **scripts**

- a folder with several **figures**

- a folder with several **tables** (e.g. .csv, txt, tsv, etc)

- a **notebook** storing all the notes (rationale of the analyses, methodology, interpretation and descriptions)

- a folder of **papers** that have relevant figures and information. 

--

- **It was always pretty hectic to *communicate* all these information with colleagues, *reproduce* all the results, and *share* my analyses.**

---
# R Markdown was a game changer!

R Markdown is an authoring framework provided by RStudio, which can keep all steps of the analyses together:

- Codes (save and execute)

- Figures and tables

- Methodology, interprations, and descriptions of the analyses

- Link to papers, and images from papers

--

- **It is now much eaier to *communicate* all these information with colleagues, *reproduce* all the results, and *share* my analyses.**
- **Several output formats, and possibilities for static and dynamic (interactive) reports.** 

---
# RStudio
RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R which includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor, and tools for plotting, history, debugging, etc. Rstudio help you to interact with R more readily.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width = '100%', fig.cap =""}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/RStudio.png") 
```
---
# Things you can do using RStudio
- Write, save and run codes

- Generate interactive web application

- Generate high quality reports and documents 

- Making presentation slides

- Version control (Git/Github)

- Many more

# R Markdown and knitr

R Markdown (.Rmd) combines **R codes** (.R) and **documentatiuon language** (.md) using **knitr**.

**knitr** ...
- inspired by Sweave
- is an R package which works as an engine for dynamic report generation in R. 
- helps us to integrate R codes into other documents (e.g. Markdown, LaTeX, HTML, etc).
- can generate HTML, PDF or Word documents.
- supports other languages, such as Python, Perl, C++, Shell scripts, etc.
- enables reproducible research

# R Markdown main sections

# R Notebook

An [**R Notebook**](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html#fig:notebook-demo) is an R Markdown document with chunks that can be executed independently and interactively, with output visible immediately beneath the input.
- **R Markdown** (knitr botton): executes and evaluates all code in one go. It can be very time-consuming when we have heavy processing
- **R Notebook** (preview botton): has caching behaviour; it evaluates a code chunk and save it. 

"The immediacy of notebook mode makes it a good choice while authoring the R Markdown document and iterating on code. When you are ready to publish the document, you can share the notebook directly, or render it to a publication format with the Knit button."

# YAML header

"YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages."

YAML header allows us to modify the output of the domunent; YAML section can evaluate R expressions.
By modifying the YAML header, we can add/change:
- Output format
- Table of content (toc)
- Tabbed sections 
- Global figure options (width and height)
- Custom CSS
- a lot more

# Structure and modify the text

.pull-left[
- Headings and sub-headings are generated using **#**:

`# Heading 1`
# Heading 1

`## Heading 2` 
## Heading 2
]

.pull-right[
- Italic texts are generated using * *:

`*This is italic!*` 

*This is italic!*

- Bold texts are generated using ** **:

`**This is bold!**` 

**This is bold!**
]

---
# Structure and modify the text

- Add hyperlinks using `[your_text](your_url)`; for example:

`[R Markdown documnetation](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)` will make [R Markdown documnetation](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) clickable, which opens up the corresponding webpage for the documentation.

- Use **single backticks** as wrappers to change the font to make the code, package names, etc different from other plain texts.

- Add bullet points using **minus** and **plus** signs as well as tab.

.pull-left[
For example:

`-` First point

Tab `+` class A

Tab `+` class B

`-` Second point

]

.pull-right[
Will result in:

- First point
  + class A
  + class B
- Second point

- It is possible to zoom, pan, label, and toggle between items in the legend 

- Save static image functionality

- Configurable tooltips

- Very easy-to-use with **ggplot**: `ggplotly(ggplot_object)`
